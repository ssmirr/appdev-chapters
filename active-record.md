# ActiveRecord

`ActiveRecord` comprises a set of classes within Ruby on Rails that help us interact with our database tables, and is one of the most powerful reasons to choose Rails. For example, if we define a class, e.g. `Contact`, and [inherit](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/769#inheritance){:target="_blank"} from `ApplicationRecord`:

```ruby
class Contact < ApplicationRecord
end
```

Then _boom_ — our class `Contact` has now inherited[^activerecord] a _tremendous_ number of powerful methods to interact with the `contacts` table, most of them related to **C**reating, **R**eading, **U**pdating, and **D**eleting records.

[^activerecord]: Actually, these methods mostly come from our grandparent class `ActiveRecord::Base` rather than our immediate parent class `ApplicationRecord`. We'll go into these details later.

We refer to these database-related classes as **models**, and we place them in the `app/models` folder within our Rails app. These classes talk to the database for us, contain most of our business logic, and are, in many ways, the heart of our applications.

## Getting started

Fork the `rolodex` repository and [create a Gitpod workspace](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/785) based on it. (If you clicked on the "Load assignment in a new window" button in Canvas, you should already have your own fork of `rolodex`; see [Getting automated feedback](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/777).)

In this repository, I've already generated a new Rails application with the `rails new` command, but there's nothing in it other than the out-of-the-box code that the generator spits out to get you started. It's a blank slate.

It will take a few minutes for Gitpod to obtain a new computer, download the code from GitHub onto it, install the Ruby gems that the project depends upon, and any other required setup[^setup]. Once it's done, you should see some feedback in the Terminal that says "Initial setup complete" and have your `$` prompt ready to receive commands.

[^setup]: `bin/setup` is a program that we write that automates the process of getting your computer ready for you to work on a codebase. Usually, that involves installing any third-party libraries that the application depends upon on to your laptop, configuring the database, filling the database with some dummy data, etc. In the real world, good teams follow the practice of including a script like this in their projects so that it's drop-dead simple for a new teammate to start contributing to a codebase. Just download the code, `bin/setup`, and they're ready to go.

    Since it's a good practice to write `bin/setup` scripts, Rails encourages it by including one in new projects by default. Gitpod will run it automatically when you first create each workspace. That initial run should be enough, but if for some reason you ever want to run it yourself, you can do so at any time from the command prompt by typing `bin/setup` and pressing <kbd>return</kbd>. 

Next, we can start the Ruby program that listens for visitors to our web site and shows them pages with the `bin/server` command. This program is known as the "web server", not to be confused with the physical computer that the program is running on, which is also often called the same thing. Rails includes a popular web server called Puma by default, but we could substitute another if we wanted to, or write our own if we were feeling ambitious.  We can stop Puma just like any other Ruby program stuck in a loop by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

Gitpod should have noticed that you started a server, and it will display a pop-up asking if you want to visit your application in a separate browser tab. If so, click yes. If you don't see that pop-up, then press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows) to bring up the Command Palette. Start typing "open port" and click the "Toggle Open Ports View" command once it appears. You will then see a pane with a button to visit your application.

Congratulations! You've got a real, live, running, industrial-grade web application. Rails makes it that easy to get up and running, unlike other frameworks where you have to spend hours, days, or weeks just setting things up to get to "Hello world". We can get right down to adding our own unique value rather than re-inventing the wheel.

Now that we've proven that we can visit a functional front-end web page, we're going to close it and focus on the back-end for the rest of this project.

## The quick way to create a table

Suppose we wanted to build an app called Rolodex that helps us keep track of our contacts. For this app, we need a table (let's call it "contacts") with three columns: first name, last name, and date of birth.

In Rails, anything that can be automated, _is_ automated. Much like we used the `rails new` command to generated dozens of folders and hundreds of files of boilerplate code, we can use another command to generate the boilerplate code that goes into creating a database table. Here is what the command looks like:

```bash
rails generate draft:model contact first_name:string last_name:string date_of_birth:date
```

 - All of the generators, of which there are many, are invoked by starting with `rails generate`.
 - We select which generator we want with the third part: in this case, `draft:model`. "Model"
  is the word we use to refer to the Ruby classes that represent our database tables, because we use those tables to _model_ the entities in our problem domains.
 - The fourth part is the name we want for the class/table; singular (the Ruby class name will be singular, as we've seen with e.g. `Person`, even though we usually think about table names as plural).
 - After that, we provide a list of the columns we want in the table, along with each column's datatype.

We need to run this command at a command prompt. The Terminal window that is running the web server is stuck in an infinite loop of listening for web requests, so we can't run any commands in there. Open another Terminal window (from the Terminal menu, select New), paste in the command above at the `$` prompt, and press <kbd>return</kbd>.

You'll see some output in the Terminal that looks something like this:

```bash
invoke  active_record
create    db/migrate/20190422125330_create_contacts.rb
create    app/models/contact.rb
```

Next, run this command:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

You'd see some output in the Terminal that looks something like this:

```bash
== 20190422125330 CreateContacts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:contacts)
   -> 0.0037s
== 20190422125330 CreateContacts: migrated (0.0037s) ==========================
```

That's it — with these two commands, you now have a fully-formed database table _and_ a Ruby class that will help us easily interact with it.

We could just as easily add another table to our database — maybe a table called "companies" with columns "name", "industry", and a few others. Run these two commands:

```
rails generate draft:model company name:string industry:string structure:string last_year_revenue:integer founded_on:date

rails db:migrate
```

Voilá — now we have two tables, and are ready to CRUD rows in them. If you want to, you can now skip ahead to the [Time to CRUD](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#time-to-crud) section to learn how to insert rows into our new tables.

But, for the curious, read on for a step-by-step explanation of what just happened:

## Pure Ruby Classes Review

In the old, pure Ruby days, if we wanted to store some attributes about a contact, we would have declared some attribute accessors like this:

```ruby
class Contact
  attr_accessor :first_name
  attr_accessor :last_name
  attr_accessor :date_of_birth
end
```

And then we'd be able to use our class like this:

```ruby
c = Contact.new
c.first_name = gets.chomp
c.last_name = gets.chomp

c.last_name # => "Betina"
```

However, once the program was finished running, whatever data we had stored would be lost. We weren't storing it _permanently_, in the long-term memory (hard disk) of the computer; we were only storing it _temporarily_, in the working memory (RAM) of the computer.

## Storing information permanently in databases

If we want to store the information permanently, we need to save it to a file on the hard drive. We could cobble together a way to write this file ourselves using the `File` class, which makes it pretty easy to write and read strings to and from disk; however, there's a _much_ better way: using a database.

**Databases** are programs that have been optimized since the 1970s to be super-efficient at storing and retrieving information on disk. In particular, **relational** databases have been dominant since the 1980s, and use a language called Structured Query Language (SQL) to store and retrieve records from two-dimensional tables. Relational databases power the vast majority of software in use today.

Fortunately for us, we don't need to learn yet another language to use them. All we have to do is [inherit](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/769#inheritance){:target="_blank"} from `ApplicationRecord` and our Ruby classes are empowered with methods, like `.save` and `.where`, that will _write all of the SQL for us_. We just have to write our usual `noun.verb`. Awesome!

## Creating the table

However, we do first need to actually create the database table, name it, and specify what columns we would like it to have. To create a table, we need to write a special Ruby program known as a **database migration**.

### Database migrations

Database migrations are responsible for evolving the structure of the database, one step at a time. Over the lifecycle of an application, we will make many changes to the database — adding tables here, renaming columns there — as we learn about our users and the problem domain.

For each evolution of the database, we create a little Ruby class that will make the change, and make any modifications to the data already existing within the table (if necessary). This Ruby class will [inherit](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/769#inheritance){:target="_blank"} from a base Rails class known as `ActiveRecord::Migration`; which will give us a bunch of methods for free[^pattern] that make it very easy to create tables, add columns, etc.

[^pattern]: You might be detecting a pattern. A lot of what we get out of Rails is powerful base classes that we inherit from when we make our own classes.

For example, in order to add a table called "contacts", we would create a migration class. In order to keep the order of the migrations straight, we begin the filenames with a timestamp. To make it easy on us, Rails will create the migration files for us and put the timestamp in the filename automatically if we run this command at a Terminal prompt.

(**Note that you don't actually need to run any of the following commands, or write any of the following code, if you already used [The Quick Way](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#the-quick-way-to-create-a-table) of creating the contacts table above.** Until you reach [Time to CRUD](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#time-to-crud), just read along.)

Generating a blank migration file:

```bash
rails generate migration SomeRandomNameForTheMigrationClass
```

The name of the migration class should be descriptive of our intention for it, so for this one let's use `CreateContacts`:

```bash
rails generate migration CreateContacts
```

If you ran this command, the Terminal output would look something like this:

```bash
invoke  active_record
create    db/migrate/20190422123800_create_contacts.rb
```

We are going to meet many `rails generate ...` commands as we continue to learn Rails. All any of the **Rails generators** do is save you some typing; they automate the creation of boilerplate files and code.

In this case, you can see that it created a file for us in the `db/migrate` folder whose name starts with a timestamp and ends in `_create_contacts.rb`.

If we head over to that file and take a look, we'll see something like this:

```ruby
class CreateContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    # ...
  end
end
```

The generator saved us some typing by defining our migration class, `CreateContacts`, and inheriting from the base class `ActiveRecord::Migration` for us.

It also stubbed out the crucial `change` method; this method is what will actually be invoked when we're ready to execute this migration to evolve the database.

Within the `change` method, we can write any Ruby we want; but of course we have a specific mission, to create a table called "contacts" with three columns, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `date_of_birth`.

Fortunately, we inherit methods from `ActiveRecord::Migration` that makes this very easy. First, we inherit a `create_table` method, which takes a `Symbol` (the name of the table that you want to create) and a block as inputs. The generator probably already stubbed out most of this for you too (the Rails generators are pretty smart, and try to write as much code on your behalf as possible based on what you named the migration class):

```ruby
class CreateContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table(:contacts) do |t|

    end
  end
end
```

We could, as always, name the block variable anything. I name it `t` because that object represents the new table that's about to be created; and within the block, we can call methods on it like `.string` and `.date` to add columns of those datatypes:

```ruby
class CreateContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table(:contacts) do |t|
      t.string(:first_name)
      t.string(:last_name)
      t.date(:date_of_birth)

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Other commonly used datatypes for columns:

```
t.boolean    # true or false
t.date       # Jan 27th
t.datetime   # 7:23pm on Jan 27th
t.decimal    # 42.42
t.integer    # 42
t.string     # Up to 255 characters
t.text       # As many characters as you want
t.time       # 7:23pm
```

The `.timestamps` method will add two columns, `created_at` and `updated_at`, that will be automatically managed by the database. And, of course, every table will have an `id` primary key column that will also be automatically managed by the database; we don't have to say anything explicitly in the migration to get that.

#### Why a block?

Why does the `create_table` method need a block of code within `do`/`end`, rather than maybe just an array or hash of column names and datatypes? It's because migrations can, if you want, get quite sophisticated; for (a contrived) example, we could do something like this:

```ruby
class CreateContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table(:contacts) do |t|
      t.string(:first_name)
      t.string(:last_name, { :default => "Doe" })
      t.date(:date_of_birth)

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Now, any new record in the table would have a default last name of `Doe`. You can also copy values over from an old table, build indexes for more performant lookups, add database-level constraints, and a bunch of other things we haven't talked about yet.

Using a block rather than just passing in data gives us flexibility, should we need it.

#### Automatically generating the entire migration

But for now, we don't need much flexibility; in fact, our migrations are 99% of time simple enough that the generator can write the entire migration automatically for us if we tell it the columns we want when we initially generate it. This commmand:

```bash
rails generate migration CreateContacts first_name:string last_name:string date_of_birth:date
```

when run, will write the entire migration automatically:

```ruby
class CreateContacts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :contacts do |t|
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name
      t.date :date_of_birth

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

The generator infers:

 - To use the `create_table` method because we started the name of the migration with `Create...`.
 - To pass the `create_table` method the argument of `:contacts` because we made the second word in the class name `...Contacts`.
 - All of the column methods to call from the datatypes we specified on the command line after the colons (`:`).
 - All of the column names to pass into each datatype method before the colons (`:`).

Voilà!

### rails db:migrate

That's it! Our migration is ready to be run. Look it over one last time, and when you're confident there are no typos, you can execute it with the following command at a Terminal prompt:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

This command will look at all of the files in the `db/migrate` folder, examine the timestamps at the beginning of the filenames, look at the current version of the database, and intelligently run only any migrations that have not yet been run.

That means you can re-run the command `rails db:migrate` as many times as you like and it won't harm anything; it won't, for example, try to add the same table twice. That's what the timestamps in the filenames are there to prevent.

You'll see output something like this[^annotate]:

```bash
== 20190422125330 CreateContacts: migrating ===================================
-- create_table(:contacts)
   -> 0.0037s
== 20190422125330 CreateContacts: migrated (0.0037s) ==========================

Annotated (1): app/models/contact.rb
```

[^annotate]: The line that says `Annotated (1): app/models/contact.rb` is from a wonderful open-source library called [annotate]() that automatically adds helpful comments to our model files for us, reminding us what columns are in each table. Every time we run `rails db:migrate`, the annotate gem will automatically update these comments.

### One-liner for adding tables

With that, the table has been created in the database! In the end, without all of the explanation around it, all we ended up doing was:

```bash
rails generate migration CreateContacts first_name:string last_name:string date_of_birth:date
```

It's that easy in Rails to add a table. You could generate the complete migration for another table with another one-liner, once you know what you want to name it and what columns you want in it. And, of course, `rails db:migrate` to run any pending migrations.

But, now that we have tables, how do we actually enter _records_?

## Models: our translators to the database

The migration is something we run once to create our table, and then we're done with it forever. But now we want _another_ class that we're going to use a million times a day to actually create, read, update, and delete rows in our table. We refer to these classes as _models_.

Create a file in the `app/models` folder called `contact.rb` and within it define a class called `Contact`:

```ruby
class Contact
end
```

But, crucially, make it inherit from `ApplicationRecord`:

```ruby
class Contact < ApplicationRecord
end
```

Amazingly, that's all we have to do. We don't have to declare attribute accessors or anything else. In inheriting from `ApplicationRecord`, the `Contact` class will automatically connect to the database, find the table named "contacts", inspect it and see what columns are in it, and define methods that are able to create, read, update, and delete rows, and a whole lot more.

### The draft:model generator does it all at once

As mentioned earlier, there's a shortcut for everything explained above. To generate the migration, columns, and model _all at once_ you can use the `draft:model` generator instead of the `migration` generator. For example, let's create another model and underlying table called `Company`:

```bash
rails generate draft:model company name:string industry:string structure:string last_year_revenue:integer founded_on:date
```

You'll see output something like:

```bash
Running via Spring preloader in process 89045
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20190423211456_create_companies.rb
      create    app/models/company.rb
      create  app/admin/companies.rb
      insert  app/admin/companies.rb
```

 - After `rails generate` we specify which generator we want to use; in this case, `draft:model`, instead of the plain old `migration` generator.
 - Then we have to say the name of the **model** that we want, which means make it **singular**, not plural.
 - Then we provide a list of the columns that we want. Each column name should be followed immediately by a colon (`:`) and then its datatype.
 - When the command is run, you can see it creates both the migration file _and_ the model file. If you go look at the files, you'll see that the generator has already written all of the necessary code in both.
 - These lines:

    ```bash
    create  app/admin/companies.rb
    insert  app/admin/companies.rb
    ```

    are doing even more work that we haven't talked about yet; configuring the new model such that it will appear in an open-source admin dashboard that we've included in our project, ActiveAdmin, to get a quick visual overview of our database tables. We'll talk about that soon.

Since most of the code for migrations and models is formulaic, the `draft:model` generator can handle writing all of it for us. Unless we want to make some tweaks to the migration, like setting default values for columns, we can go ahead and:

```
rails db:migrate
```

without even looking at the generated code, although it's usually a good idea to at least glance at the migration file to make sure you didn't make any typos in column names.

## Time to CRUD

Okay, so now that we've stepped through the long explanation, it's time to actually _use_ our model. It only takes five seconds to create a table if we're using the shortcut; but now how do add rows to it?

### Command prompt vs rails console

Let's learn the methods we've inherited from `ActiveRecord` to make it easy. To do so, open a new Terminal and run the command `rails console` (or `rails c` for short). This will change the prompt from

```
$
```

to

```
[1] pry(main)>
```

The former is the **command prompt** and the latter is the **rails console**. _It's important to always know which one you are in._

`rails console` is an interactive way to try out Ruby with immediate feedback. It's quicker than writing into a file and then running it. You can only do Ruby in here (like `"hello".capitalize`). You _cannot_ do command prompt things (like `cd` or `ls` or `rails generate migration...`).

If you want to get out of rails console and back to the command prompt, which is like quitting an app to get back to the desktop of your computer, then type `exit` — or just open a new Terminal window.

## CREATE

### new

In rails console, try the following:

```ruby
Contact.all
```

You'll see that we get back an empty array. Right now, we have no rows in our table. We can confirm this with `Contact.all.count`. We do `Contact.all.count` so often that Rails lets us take a shortcut — we can just do `Contact.count` directly.

A crucial thing to remember: when you are talking to the **whole table**, you are referencing the _class_ `Contact`, so **use a capital letter**. If you did `contact.count`, what error message would you expect? Try it and see.

Like any Ruby class[^literal_shorthand] we instantiate a new, blank object with the `.new` method:

[^literal_shorthand]: Remember Array, Hash, or even String, before we got to their [literal](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/758#array-literals) [shorthand](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/767#hash-literals) [syntaxes](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/757#string-literals)? We always started with `.new`, and then built up from scratch.

```ruby
c = Contact.new
```

As usual we store the new object in a variable so that we can continue to work with it; in this case, we named the variable `c`. This object has attribute setter methods for every column in the table:

```ruby
c.first_name = "Raghu"
c.last_name = "Betina"
```

We didn't have to declare the `attr_accessor`s like we did for pure Ruby classes — by inheriting from `ApplicationRecord`, our `Contact` class gains superpowers. It connects to the database, figures out what columns are in the "contacts" table, and automatically defines methods to access each column that exists.

### save

So far, this is just like a pure Ruby class with `attr_accessor`s. But, crucially, we have the `.save` method now. Try it:

```ruby
c.save
```

Whoa! Some fancy new output. What you see is the actual SQL that is generated in order to transact with the database and save the data permanently to a row.

Now you can just type `c` and it should show you that `c` has been inserted into the database **and it has been assigned an ID number**.

If you exit `rails console`, shut down the computer, and come back into `rails console` tomorrow, and do `Contact.count`, you will see `1` — _the data will still be there_ (although the variable `c` will not — try it). We have saved it _permanently_. Try `Contact.all`, and you will see that the array of rows is no longer empty!

Add a few more contacts:

```ruby
c = Contact.new
c.first_name = "Minnie"
c.last_name = "Mouse"
c.date_of_birth = "November 18, 1928"
c.save
Contact.count # => 2

c = Contact.new
c.first_name = "Mickey"
c.last_name = "Mouse"
c.date_of_birth = "May 15, 1928"
c.save
Contact.count # => 3
```

Why does it work to re-use the variable `c` here? Well, when we `.save` on the prior one, we've entered the record in to the table and it is assigned an ID. Then we throw away the contents of the _variable_ `c` and replace it with a brand new, blank row with `Contact.new` — but that's okay, because the old data is stored on disk and we can always look it up by its ID number if we need it.

## READ

### all

**Returns:** an array of records

To retrieve all of the rows from a table, you can call `.all` on the class:

```ruby
contact_list = Contact.all
```

The return value of `.all` is an `Array`-like object (technically it's an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, but we can do all of our usual `Array` methods on it — `.each`, etc). From now on I'll refer to these `Array`-like objects as "**collections**".

### count

**Returns:** an `Integer`

We've already met `.count`, which tells you how many records are in a collection:

```ruby
Contact.all.count
```

### first

**Returns:** a single record

```ruby
c = Contact.all.first
```

### last

**Returns:** a single record

Returns the last record in a collection.

```ruby
c = Contact.all.last
```

### Attribute getter methods

However you got it, once you have an individual row stored in a variable, let's call it `c`, then you have a method for each column to retrieve the value for that cell:

```ruby
c = Contact.all.last

c.id
c.first_name
c.last_name
c.date_of_birth
c.created_at
c.updated_at
```

What is the return value if you try calling a method for a column that doesn't exist?

```ruby
c.middle_name
```

**RTEM!** You're going to see it _a lot_.

### order

**Returns:** an array of records

The `.order` method lets you sort your collections by one or more columns. The argument to `.order` is a `Hash`, where the _key_ is the _column_ you want to sort by, and the _value_ is either `:asc` (for ascending order) or `:desc` (for descending order):

```ruby
Contact.all.order({ :last_name => :asc })
```

If you send `.order` a `Symbol` alone, outside of a `Hash`, then ascending order is assumed:

```ruby
Contact.all.order(:last_name)
```

To break ties, you can provide multiple columns in the `Hash`:

```ruby
Contact.all.order({ :last_name => :asc, :first_name => :asc, :date_of_birth => :desc })
```

This would first order by last name, then break ties using first name, then break ties using date of birth.

### reverse

**Returns:** an array of records

`.reverse` reverses the ordering of a collection. Not particularly common, since you can use `:asc` and `:desc` to specify the direction you want explicitly, but there it is:

```ruby
Contact.order(:first_name).reverse
```

### where

**Returns:** an array of records

Perhaps the most important READ method is `.where`. This is our bread-and-butter tool for _filtering_ a collection of rows down using various criteria.

The argument to `.where` is a `Hash`, where the _key_ is the _column_ you want to filter by, and the _value_ is the criteria you want to filter by:

```ruby
Contact.all.where({ :id => 2 })
```

A bit of syntactic sugar — to save us some typing, we can call `.where` directly on the class if we want to, rather than calling `.all` first:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" })
```

You can provide multiple columns to filter by in the `Hash`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse", :first_name => "Minnie" })
```

### where always returns a collection, not a single row

**The return value from `.where` is always a collection, regardless of how many results there are.**

Whether there are 0, 1, or a million results, you still have an array. What would you expect if you tried the following?

```ruby
Contact.where({ :id => 2 }).first_name
```

Try it. RTEM!

 So, **use `.at(0)`** (a.k.a `.first`)  or `.at(-1)` (a.k.a. `.last`) or some other method **to retrieve an element** from the array if you want **to do something with an individual record**:

```ruby
c = Contact.where({ :id => 2 }).at(0)
c.first_name
```

### Using where with an array of criteria

**Returns:** an array of records

You can even use an `Array` in the argument to `.where`; it will then bring back the rows that match _any_ of the criteria for that column:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => ["Betina", "Woods"] })
```

### Chaining wheres

**Returns:** an array of records

Since `.where` returns another collection, you can chain `.where`s one after the other:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).where({ :first_name => "Minnie" })
```

This _narrows_ the search.

### where(this).or(that)

**Returns:** an array of records

You can _broaden_ the search with `.or`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :first_name => "Mickey" }).or(Contact.where({ :last_name => "Betina" }))
```

This may look a little funny. We tack `.or` onto the end of one collection, and the argument to `.or` is an _entire query_, starting from the class again. The return value is both collections merged together.

### where.not(this)

**Returns:** an array of records

You can _negate_ a criteria with `.not`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).where.not({ :first_name => "Mickey" })
```

You tack `where.not` on to a collection and it accepts all the same arguments as `.where`, but the result set is all of the records in the original collection _except_ the ones that match the criteria.

### Where is everything

**Everything from looking up a movie's director to putting together a feed in a social network ultimately boils down to `.where`s and `.each`s.** I can't emphasize the importance of `.where` enough. Ask lots of questions.

### pluck

**Returns:** a regular Ruby array of scalar values (_not_ records, and _not_ an individual value)

Once you've retrieved the right subset of records, you can peel off the values in just one column with `.pluck`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).pluck(:first_name) # => ["Minnie", "Mickey"]
```

The `.pluck` method returns an `Array` of values. This can be handy in conjunction with the ability to pass `.where` an `Array` of criteria to filter by, e.g.:

```ruby
shawshank_id = 4
shawshank_roles = Role.where({ :movie_id => shawshank_id })
cast_ids = shawshank_roles.pluck(:actor_id) # => [12, 94, 34]
shawshank_actors = Actor.where({ :id => cast_ids }) # => the collection of Shawshank's actors
```

 - Returns an `Array` of values in the column.
    - _Not_ a single value, even if there was only one record in the `ActiveRecord_Relation`.
    - _Not_ an `ActiveRecord_Relation`, so you can no longer use methods like `.where`, `.order`, etc. You can use `Array` methods like `.each`, `.at`, etc.
 - The argument to `.pluck` must be a `Symbol` that matches the name of a column in the table.
 - You cannot call `.pluck` on an individual ActiveRecord row. If you want the value in a column for an individual row, simply call the accessor method directly:

    ```ruby
    # for an array of records
    people.last_name # undefined method for array; bad
    people.pluck(:last_name) # => ["Betina", "Woods"]; good

    # for an individual record
    person.last_name # => "Woods"; good
    person.pluck(:last_name) # undefined method for Person; bad
    ```

### distinct

It is sometimes possible to retrieve a collection of records that contains duplicates, which we may not want (because it will e.g. throw off our count). To remove duplicates, you can use the `.distinct` method:

```ruby
# Imagine Eddie's ID is 42 in the actors table:
eddies_roles = Role.where({ :actor_id => 42 })
# But what if Eddie played multiple roles in the same film?
eddies_movie_ids = eddies_roles.pluck(:movie_id)
# => [1, 3, 3, 12, 19] This array now has duplicate IDs in it.
# If we use it to do a lookup of movies, we'll get duplicate rows:
bad_eddies_movies = Movie.where({ :id => eddies_movie_ids }) 
# We can use .distinct to solve the problem:
good_eddies_movies = Movie.where({ :id => eddies_movie_ids }).distinct
```

## UPDATE

To update a row, first you need to locate it:

```ruby
c = Contact.where({ :id => 2 }).first
```

And then assign whatever new values you want to:

```ruby
c.first_name = "Minerva"
```

And then **don't forget to save the changes**:

```ruby
c.save
```

That's it.

## DELETE

To delete a row, first find it:

```ruby
c = Contact.where({ :id => 2 }).first
```

And then,

```ruby
c.destroy
```

Intense.

## Less commonly used queries

### Fuzzy criteria

`.where` can also be used to search for partial matches by passing a fragment of SQL in a `String`, rather than passing a `Hash`:

```ruby
Contact.where("last_name LIKE ?", "%bet%")
```

The `?` in the first argument is a placeholder where the second argument, `"%bet%"`, gets inserted[^sql_injection].

The `%` characters are wildcards, which match anything in that position.

So that query would find all rows that have the fragment "bet" anywhere within the `last_name` column.

[^sql_injection]: This is an advanced safety feature of Rails that prevents [SQL injection attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection){:target="_blank"}.

### Less than or greater than

You can search for rows less than or greater than certain criteria:

```ruby
Contact.where("date_of_birth > ?", 30.years.ago)
Contact.where("last_name >= ? AND last_name <= ?", "A", "C")
```

Notice that you can have multiple placeholders `?` in the SQL fragment, and the subsequent arguments will be plugged in in order.

That last query, for a value within a range, can also be written with a `Hash` and a `Range`:

```ruby
Instructor.where({ :last_name => ("A".."C") })
```

This is particularly handy for searching for records within a particular range of times:

```ruby
start_date = 7.days.ago
end_date = Date.today
Contact.where({ :created_at => (start_date..end_date) })
```

With Ruby `Range`s, two dots means inclusive of the second value, and three dots means exclusive of the second value. E.g., `(1..4)` is 1, 2, 3, and 4; `(1...4)` is only 1, 2, and 3.

### limit

**Returns:** an array of records

You can limit the number of records in a collection with `.limit`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).limit(10)
```

This will return no more than 10 records.

### offset

**Returns:** an array of records

You can skip some rows in the result set with `.offset`. This is useful for e.g. retrieving the second page of records, or choosing a random record:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).offset(10).limit(10)
```

### maximum

**Returns:** a single value (of whatever datatype the column is)

You can calculate the largest/latest value in a particular column within a collection with `.maximum`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).maximum(:date_of_birth)
```

### minimum

**Returns:** a single value (of whatever datatype the column is)

You can calculate the smallest/oldest value in a particular column within a collection with `.minimum`:

```ruby
Contact.where({ :last_name => "Mouse" }).minimum(:date_of_birth)
```

### average

**Returns:** a single value (`Integer` or `Float`)

You can calculate the average value in a particular column within a collection with `.average`:

```ruby
Review.where({ :venue_id => 4 }).average(:rating)
```

## Adding or removing columns from your table

We have a few tools to make changes to our database once we have already run our migrations.

First and foremost, we can generate new migrations to add new tables and modify existing tables. To modify existing tables, the most common tools we use are `add_column` and `remove_column`.

Generate a new **migration** (not a whole **model** like above) at a Terminal prompt with, for example:

```bash
rails g migration AddTitleToInstructors
```

or

```bash
rails g migration RemoveLastNameFromInstructors
```

Try to pick a name for the migration that's descriptive of the change that you want make, like I did above.

Then, go into the new migration file and add instructions to make the change you want within the `change` method (or the `up` method, if that's what you find inside instead of `change`):

```bash
def change
  add_column :instructors, :title, :string
end
```

or

```bash
def change
  remove_column :instructors, :last_name
end
```

Then execute the migration with `rails db:migrate` at a Terminal prompt.

If your database gets into a weird state (usually caused by deleting old migration files), your ultimate last resort is

```bash
rails db:drop
```

This will destroy your entire database and all the data within it. Then, you can fix your migrations and re-run all from scratch with `rails db:migrate`.

Much more information about migrations can be found at the official Rails Guide:

## Conclusion

Now you have the ability to **Create**, **Update**, and **Delete** records. And by creatively chaining `.where`, `.not`, and `.or`, you can (with ActiveRecord's help) write pretty much any SQL query you're ever going to need in order to **Read** anything you want; from a simple one-to-many lookup all the way through a complicated self-referential social network feed. It's just going to require a bit of practice.
